Developer Copy to Dropbox Readme
================================

Developer Copy to Dropbox, DCTD for short, is a tool I created to help copy popular applications used in development environments to your Dropbox for easy synchronization between multiple computers.

Requirements
------------

* A fairly recent OS X. OS X 10.5+ should be fine.
* Dropbox
* Xcode (Free in the App Store)
* Cool apps

Suggestions
-----------

Move your Dropbox to a general folder, not based on your username. This is easily accomplished by changing your Dropbox preferences in the menu bar. This is recommended, unless you use the same username across all computers you access for development and always will in the future.

Supported Apps (Version Tested With)
------------------------------------

* Coda (1.7.4)
* Tower (1.7.4)
* FileZilla (3.5.0)
* Sequel Pro (0.9.9.1)
* MAMP/MAMP PRO (2.0.1)
* Linkinus (2.4.1)
* Firefox (7.0.1)
* Google Chrome (15.0.874.121)
* Growl - Tickets Preferences Only (1.2.2)

How Do I Run?
-------------

Create a new directory, get the latest source through git or here. Then run `sudo ./DCTD.sh`
